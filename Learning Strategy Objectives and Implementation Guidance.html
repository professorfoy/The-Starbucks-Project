<p><strong>Implementation Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the SBUX Project is to make the connection between abstract, theoretical textbook learning with a practical term project. This approach allows students to transform their learning from the abstract world to the real, concrete world by producing experiences that allows them to absorb information and analyze a business more thoroughly.</p>
<p>A prevailing problem in most accounting curricula is the lack of exposure to deal with real life businesses in a high level experiential learning environment. Compared to other fields, (e.g., education and the physical sciences), the accounting field offers limited field experiences in both undergraduate and graduate course of study. Internships and VITA programs are probably the most well-known, but they are relatively few and far between compared to the vast potential opportunities that could be created. Just reading the text and doing book exercises has its limitations. Most accounting classes do not offer opportunities to go into the field and try to incorporate what students are learning in the books to what businesses are actually doing. Accounting students seemingly get stuck in the abstract, theoretical world.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the SBUX Project is to deliver a venue based experiential learning environment that is flexible to meet program (PLOs) and course learning (CLOs) objectives in a vast majority of accounting curricula that deepens understanding of accounting by connecting accounting theory to practice the basic skill sets of collaborative group work, leadership, and communication skills. It is open access and free to implement. Although the objectives outlined in this term project may not perfectly map onto any particular school’s PLO and/or CLO model, it provides a good starting point that is flexible enough to map on to existing on contemplated PLOs and CLOs. The goal of connecting theory to practice is important as many students do not get the opportunity to put accounting into practice until they enter the workforce.</p>
<p>The strategy that we use is a risk based approach. Students assess risk to determine possible areas of concern to users of financial information, analyze results, and make recommendations to internal and external users of information. Instructors could focus on tax or GAAP issues, or a particular focus on certain areas of the financial statements by just altering the questions and the reading content of the Form 10-K.</p>
<p>This project has several built-in characteristics which allows flexibility for an instructor to tailor it to their needs. These characteristic include: project length, project length timing, class modality, course level and type, deliverable submission timing, individual verse group assignments, group dynamics, grading weights, virtual visitation option.</p>
<p><strong>Project Length.</strong> The SBUX Project has been offered in 15-week and 7-week sessions. It is not recommended to run it in a compressed course less than six weeks, or compromises will have to be made to condense the project.</p>
<p><strong>Project Length Timing.</strong> Instructors have the flexibility to alter the length of the project over the course of the semester. Although we feel that it is best to implement it over the course of the entire semester, instructors can alter that timing to meet their specific needs.
Class Modality. We have successfully implemented the SBUX Project in classes where students meet in-person, hybrid, and fully online environments. Instructors can easily adapt this project into any type of modality.</p>
<p><strong>Course Level and Type.</strong> We have implemented the SBUX Project in various course levels from a fundamentals of accounting to graduate level financial statement analysis. It have been run in fundamentals, intermediate, auditing, financial statement analysis classes. Instructors can alter the readings and questions to adjust to the level and virtually all type of accounting course. For example, for a corporate taxation class, all questions can ask what the corporate tax effects are instead of the effects on GAAP based financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverable Submission Timing.</strong> The flexibility of timing of the submissions for deliverables is a key feature. We have allowed longer deliverable one submissions for lower level courses to accommodate more exposure to introductory concepts. Flexibility also allows for submission timings to be altered in the Fall and Spring semesters when Thanksgiving and Spring Breaks are not in sync over a 15-week semester.</p>
<p><strong>Individual verse Group Assignments.</strong> An important organizational feature that we incorporated into the project is to work individually and collaboratively. Accounting instructors face an assessment issue with many projects. For accreditation purposes, projects may have to have the ability to be individually assessed, yet in the working world, many projects are collaborative in nature and require group work. In the development of this project, we were sensitive to this imbalance. Therefore, a key feature of the SBUX Project is that allows free collaboration, mimicking the real world, yet assessed both individually and by group to be sensitive to the needs of academia. In our version, group collaboration is required. We have implemented the SBUX Project by grading the first, second, third and fifth deliverables on an individual basis. The fourth deliverable, a group presentation is graded on a group basis. For instructors interested in assigning students individually or by group throughout each deliverable, the project is flexible to allow it in any or all deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Group Dynamics.</strong> At the beginning of the semester, we have set up randomly assigned groups of approximately four students to allow for collaboration. We have found this number optimum, but instructors can deviate and alter workloads based on group assignments. It is not necessary that instructors follow our exact approach to randomly assign students. However, it is the author’s experience that students come from all different backgrounds and personal experiences.</p>
<p>To ensure that all students assigned within a group are collaborating, we implement another key feature and require each student to take on a leadership role which rotates through each of the first four deliverables. We coin this phrase rotational leadership. When in the rotational leadership role, student leaders facilitate communications, exchange of ideas among group members, and make sure that all group members receive a peer review of their work before submission to the instructor. When instructors need to decide when to assign students into groups, our advice is to assign them after the last day of the add/drop period.</p>
<p><strong>Grading Weights.</strong> Each deliverable grade is weighted based on the level of work involved. The authors placed heavier emphasis on deliverable three as that requires more time and effort relative to the other deliverables. Instructors can alter the amount of work involved in each deliverable. For example, if instructors would like to emphasis more detailed Excel techniques and financial statement analysis, and less emphasis on presentation, the weights can be altered to accommodate such a grading structure.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Visitation Option.</strong> For online courses, instructors have raised concerns about students who cannot physically visit a Starbuck store location. During the COVID-19 crisis, a virtual visitation option was successfully created. Although a virtual option is presented for instructors to consider, if at all possible, the physical should be the primary choice. A virtual field visit has its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>SBUX Project Course Learning Objectives:
CLO 1:	Create individualized work in a collaborative group setting.
CLO 2:	Organize, structure and present complex financial data for analysis.
CLO 3:	Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of company operations.
CLO 4:	Explain how different types of risk can have an adverse effect on financial statements.
CLO 5:	Propose how management can mitigate risks to strengthen financial statements.
CLO 6:	Synthesize connections between the first three deliverables.
CLO 7:	Reflect with a critical review on how abstract accounting concepts learned in the textbook connects to concrete real world experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Strategy Efficacy</strong></p>
<p>We tested the effectiveness of the case in 15 undergraduate accounting (308 students) and 12 graduate accounting (231 students) classes at four public universities . The case was used with 539 students over a four-year period (2018-2021). See Table 1.</p>
<p>In each class section, the survey was administered after the submission date of the fifth deliverable (near the end of each semester). The survey instrument was structured on a seven-point Likert scale anchored by “strongly agree = 1” and “strongly disagree = 7.”</p>
<p>Student efficacy data are presented in Table 2, Project Evaluation Results. The data indicates that the project helped students to clarify the contents of accounting (65.1 percent strongly agree or agree), contents of financial statement analysis (71.6 percent strongly agree or disagree) and understand preparation of financial statements under GAAP (69.8 percent strongly agree or disagree). In addition, students indicated that the case study helped them understand the alignment between practice and education (75.7 percent strongly agree or disagree), the project was innovative (72.2 percent strongly agree or disagree), motivated them to work harder in the class (65.5 percent strongly agree or disagree), and believed that the time devoted to the project was worthwhile (67.1 percent strongly agree or disagree). See Table 2.</p>
<p>Two-way ANOVAs were run to examine the effect of modality (in classroom/hybrid/online) and course level (advanced/intermediate/introductory) on each of the seven measures of efficacy depicted in Table 1. In unreported results, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that the group means for modality or course level are equal for the following efficacy measures: 1. The Starbucks project helped me clarify the contents of accounting in general by making them easier to understand; 5. The project was innovative; and 6. The project motivated me to work harder in the class.</p>
<p>Results are shown where either the modality or course level, or the interaction term between the two variables are statistically significant (p &lt; .05). For each of the four panels presented below, a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests were run, which confirmed that there were no significant differences between the groups.</p>
<p>We also asked students to provide verbal feedback about the case. Students overwhelmingly agreed that the SBUX Project was innovative, worthwhile and it motivated them to work harder. Importantly, it helped them understand accounting better and helped them connect abstract educational theory to real world practical concrete applications. The two-way ANOVAs helped us to understand if there were differences between groups of students who participated in the SBUX Project at different levels and course delivery methods. The results informed us that it did not matter if the course was introductory, intermediate, or advanced, or whether it students took the course in a classroom, hybrid or fully online in order to help make accounting easier to understand.</p>
<p>The results in Table 3, Panels A and B, informed us that students were more likely to agree with the statement that the project helped clarify contents of financial statement analysis, and that the project helped in gaining a greater understanding of accounting requirements pertinent to the preparation of a company’s financial statements under GAAP when the modality was in-classroom than hybrid/online. Although the SBUX Project has been implemented successfully in hybrid and fully online environments, it is our assessment that students felt in-classroom interaction and discussions tended to be more beneficial and hands-on. See Table 3.</p>
<p>Efficacy is further supported by five independent faculty class observers who have witnessed the SBUX Project implemented in actual classes and have positively communicated as to its content and professional presentation . Additionally, hundreds of deliverable five student reflections positively expressed its innovativeness, how much it helped understand accounting concepts, and how it helped connect accounting theory to practice.</p>
