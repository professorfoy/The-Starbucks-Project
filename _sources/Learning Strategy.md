# Learning Strategy

The Starbucks Corporation was chosen for a venue based experiential learning project due to two main reasons. First, student feedback suggested that almost everyone is cognizant that the business exists due to its ubiquitous nature in almost every major market throughout the United States. In each course this project has been implemented, our anecdotal experiences confirmed that this has been true. Second, Starbucks is a wholly owned, publicly traded corporation with easily accessible financial data.

To achieve the stated objectives, the SBUX Project is divided into five deliverables that are due incrementally during the semester. Each deliverable has a weighted grade based on the level of work involved. Students must follow each deliverable sequentially in order to receive a grade for the term project. Students are provided a grading rubric so they can understand how each deliverable is to be measured. 
Figure 1, Deliverables Process Flowchart describes a summation of the deliverable process for the SBUX Project.
