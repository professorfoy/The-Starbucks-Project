# Requirements

Deliverable One: Financial Statement Analysis

Deliverable one focuses on project objectives: 1) create individualized work in a collaborative group setting and 2) organize, structure and present complex financial data for analysis. These objectives allow students to become familiar with collaborating with a newly formed group and analyze complex new information. To work toward accounting proficiency, students integrate foundational information found in their assigned accounting textbook and other course materials. The deliverable one tasks are scaffolded in sequential order to allow students to learn step by step some of the basics of financial statement analysis.   

To be successful with this project, students must become very familiar with the financial information and business operations of Starbucks (Starbucks Corporation 2021). The best information about Starbucks normally comes from the public documents that are filed with the SEC, specifically, the 10-Ks. To work toward accounting proficiency, students integrate foundational information found in their assigned accounting textbook and the public documents filed by Starbucks. 

Students will have to perform the tasks below. The first deliverable is divided into five tasks that must be performed in the exact sequence that is shown in this guide.  

Task #1: Collaborate with other students in groups

The accounting field is increasingly requiring collaborative work, yet the performance of employees of an accounting firm still needs to be individually assessed. An important part of the SBUX Project requires students to work collaboratively yet assessed individually. Students are randomly placed in groups. Students exchange contact information with their teammates, hold an initial group discussion, form a method of communication acceptable to all, draft a meeting schedule and elect a group leader to centralize group communications and peer reviews.  

Task #2:  Excel Spreadsheet Data Set Up

Students visit the Starbucks website to obtain and gather the Income Statement  (Consolidated Statement of Earnings), Balance Sheet (Consolidated Balance Sheets) and Cash Flow Statements (Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) for the past three years, derived from the Starbucks Form 10-K filings. Although students can obtain this information from the EDGAR database, for the 2021 year, we directed students to logon to the Starbucks homepage, and follow the path About Us/Investor Relations/Annual Reports/FY21 Annual Report.  

Students drill down to the three financial statements as well as the Index for Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In Excel, students create three blank worksheets to display at least three years of data (or however many years the instructor requires ) for each financial statement. For analytical purposes, students are required to present the information from the earliest year to the later years. For example, with financial data from the latest year 2021, students label the header row in column B: 2019, column C: 2020, column D: 2021. In the teaching notes, we provide visual displays walking readers through these directions. The transfer of financial data from the three financial statements is to help students achieve the objective of organizing, structuring, and presenting complex financial data for analysis.   

Task #3:  Horizontal, Vertical and Ratio Analysis

Students build on the financial data in the Excel  spreadsheets by conducting horizontal, vertical, and ratio analysis that are commonly demonstrated even in fundamental accounting textbooks. In addition to textbook examples, YouTube has many demonstrations on how to set up horizontal, vertical, and ratio analysis. For the Cash Flow Statements, to remain at a more basic level of analyses we limited the analysis to the line items Net cash provided/used by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 

Performing horizontal, vertical and ratio analyses provides an opportunity to achieve further objectives. As students insert rows and columns, create proper headers and footers, use color coordinated schemes, develop formulas to subtotal and total data, as well as develop ratios, they demonstrate an understanding of how to use basic features of Excel. As they develop the horizontal and vertical analyses and select various ratios, they demonstrate they can calculate changes in financial data and ratios to help make business decisions. Combining horizontal and vertical analyses with ratio analysis provide powerful analytical tools to expose areas of risk for decision makers.
Task #4: Create charts and trend analysis of the horizontal, vertical and ratio analysis calculations.

Students are required to chart the results of their horizontal, vertical and ratio analyses.  To create as few charts as possible, while still retaining the ability to analyze them, this exercise is simplified. Figure 2, Required Charts to Create shows the required charts students create. 

For an Indirect Cash Flow Statements presentation, students should not try to chart each line item within the operating, investing, and financing activities (that level of analysis is outside the scope of this exercise). Figure 3, Visual Representations of Horizontal, Vertical and Ratio Analyses, contains examples. Note that the presentation of the charts on the x-axis is chronological from the earliest to latest years, which is in reverse order from the presentation of the financial statements. 

Appendix A provides video examples of horizontal, vertical, ratio analysis and charting.

Task #5: Individually upload Document via the institution’s course learning management system. 

Although this deliverable relies on a collaborative effort, each group member is to create their own spreadsheet and have other group members review it prior to submitting it to the instructor. The group leader for deliverable one is responsible for making sure that each member of the group is peer reviewed by at least one other member of the group. For deliverable one, only Excel files should be accepted in MS Office format. 

Deliverable Two: Connecting Theory to Practice – Company Level Risk Analysis

Deliverable two begins the process of bridging abstract theoretical accounting information learned in the textbook and other course materials to real life concrete experiences. The objectives of deliverable two are to 1) demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of company operations and 2) explain how different types of risk have an adverse effect on financial statements. Students will have to perform the tasks below. The second deliverable is divided into four tasks that should be performed in exact sequence. 

Task #1: Continue to Collaborate with Group Members

Students continue to collaborate within their assigned groups to complete this deliverable, but the work product will be graded individually. Students elect a new group leader to centralize group communications and peer reviews.

Task #2: Open the Starbucks 10-K, read selected parts and identify and evaluate a risk factor of interest that could come true.

To continue to bridge abstract theoretical accounting to real life concrete experiences, we require students to focus on company level risk. They review select Parts I and II in the Form 10-K, which contain discussions on many types of risks that the business may be exposed to. Students come to understand a company’s business model, how it segments its financial information, how it categorizes and earns revenue, risk factors it may be exposed to, properties it may own, legal proceedings, Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Index to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Task #3: Based on deliverable two readings, and prior deliverable one analysis, answer three short essay questions. 

Equipped with a much greater understanding of the business at the firm level, we ask students to answer three short essay questions. The first question requires students to select and evaluate one company level risk factor and if the risk did actually materialize, explain in their own words the effect on the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and the Cash Flow Statements. 

The second question requires students to write a one to two paragraph analysis that compares management’s assertions with their understanding of the company, and identify any possible misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent information. This exercise forces students to read more attentively to the information presented with professional skepticism in mind.

The third question requires students to read a risk selected by the instructor and demonstrate their understanding of how some of the financial ratios in deliverable one would be affected. In our implementation of this project, we ask students the effects of a crisis if coffee beans increase in price. We encourage students to conduct a what-if analysis and restate the latest year’s financials.

Task #4: Individually upload Document via the institution’s course learning management system.

Although this deliverable relies on a collaborative effort like deliverable one, each group member is to create their own Word document and have other group members review it prior to submitting it to the instructor. Once students have completed the essay questions, they will upload their Word file into the learning management system. Word files allow for tracking changes and have more sophisticated features to give feedback. 

Deliverable Three: Connecting Theory to Practice – Store Level Risk Analysis

By conducting a store level risk analysis, deliverable three continues the process of building on information learned in the textbook, the study of financial information, and risk focused 10-K information to bridge abstract theoretical accounting to real life concrete experiences. The objectives of deliverable three are to 1) demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of company operations, 2) explain how different types of store level risk have an adverse effect on financial statements, and 3) propose how management can mitigate risks to strengthen financial statements. 

In this portion of the SBUX Project, heightened attention is given to real concrete experiences as students visit Starbucks stores in their local area. The third deliverable is divided into four tasks that must be performed in exact sequence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual option was created that is available with the teaching notes.

Task #1: Continue to Collaborate with Group Members

Students continue to collaborate within their assigned groups to complete this deliverable and the work product continues to be graded individually. Students elect a new group leader to centralize group communications and peer reviews. The group leader should communicate and ensure that all group members know which Starbucks locations have been selected by each group member.

Task #2: Select at least two different Starbucks stores, visit each of them for at least one hour, identify and evaluate one store level risk factor of interest that could come true.

To continue to bridge abstract theoretical accounting to real life concrete experiences, we require students to engage in a store level risk based approach. This is the core stage where venue based experiential learning takes place. Students visit Starbucks store(s) and attempt to connect accounting theory with store level operations. We require students to visit two different Starbucks locations (to observe consistencies and inconsistencies between them). Students are encouraged to visit standalone stores and not those located in a Target, Barnes and Noble, supermarket, a school, or similar location. Many of these operations display a Starbucks logo and appear to be corporate owned but may not be. Instructors have the flexibility to set up the rules how students will visit the stores. When possible, we encourage pairs.

At the stores, students should sit and observe everything that is going on around them for at least one hour. Visiting the stores with group members has the advantage of allowing students to discuss in real time the information in the spreadsheets and risk analysis that were produced in deliverables one and two. It is important to share ideas and talk about observations with others. The following are some types of observations students can observe for to help answer the required essay questions for this deliverable: 

1.	Are cashiers able to make an unrecorded sale, or pass beverages over the counter for free? Does there appear to be an accounting for courtesy beverages?
2.	What inventory is for sale? Can inventory be stolen? Is there a specific category or single item more susceptible than others? How is inventory accounted for? 
3.	What is the quality of signage, lighting, seating arrangements, age and quality of seats and tables, parking issues, drive up issues, etc. How do those items connect to accounting?

Task #3: Based on deliverable three observations, and prior deliverable one and two analysis, answer four short multi-part essay questions.

With a more comprehensive understanding of the financials, a greater understanding of company level risks, and experience observing actual store level operations, we ask students to answer four short essay questions to help connect theory to practice. The first question requires students to select and evaluate one store level risk factor of their choice and if the risk did actually materialize, conduct a what-if analysis using hypothetical figures and explain in their own words the effect on the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and the Cash Flow Statements on the latest published annual financial data. 

The second question is broken into parts that analyze inventory issues and provide hypotheticals if an inventory related risk materializes and extrapolate and map those results onto the financials. For example, we ask students to imagine one low profit margin refrigerated item is stolen once per day in every Starbucks store worldwide for an entire year. How would that affect Cost of Sales and how many more of those items would Starbucks have to sell to make up the losses?

The third question is broken into parts that analyze fixed assets and depreciation issues. This question helps students understand very abstract concepts such as the meaning of “estimated useful life” in a straight line depreciation calculation or understanding how a fixed asset theoretically contributes to the business.

The fourth question allows students to demonstrate their understanding of how accounting theory connects to practice by making a recommendation to management as to how it could increase revenue, control its expenses, or make its assets more efficient and its effect on at least one financial ratio.

Task #5: Individually upload Document via the institution’s course learning management system.

The same parameters for deliverable two apply to the deliverable three submission process.  

Deliverable Four: Communicating Results

The objective of deliverable four is to synthesize connections between the first three deliverables. Students construct a story that starts with highly abstract financial information from deliverable one, synthesize it with information learned in deliverable two, and connect it to concrete experiences learned in deliverable three. Students continue to work in assigned groups and are graded as a group. Students present findings to the class by making a recorded PowerPoint presentation. 

Task #1: Continue to Collaborate with Group Members

As opposed to the first three deliverables, this deliverable is a group graded project and each group member is expected to substantially contribute. Once again, students elect a new group leader to centralize group communications and contributions from each group member. Communications among the group will be critical to make sure work is compiled, rehearsed, and presented timely.

Task #2: Each group member reviews their results of all three deliverables with group members, integrating and formulating a story that discusses their findings and how management portrays that information.

Group members should come to a consensus on how they would like to tell their story. Not every finding is to be discussed, but rather only the ones that the group finds most interesting and can be conveyed in a concise presentation. This should not be an onerous task as group members have been presumed to give peer reviews and be familiar with other group member’s work from prior deliverables. 

Task #3: Rehearse, record, and present a PowerPoint presentation that clearly shows contributions by all group members.

Once students come to a consensus on what they will discuss, they draft a storyboard, and rehearse the presentation. We ask each member of the group to record an approximately 90-120 second sound bite explaining their portion of the group’s findings. We target the presentation for six to eight minutes.

Task #4: The group leader uploads the PowerPoint document via the institution’s course learning management system.

The group leader for deliverable four is responsible for making sure that the PowerPoint presentation is submitted on behalf of the group.

Deliverable Five: Self-Reflection

The objective of deliverable five is to reflect with a critical review on how abstract accounting concepts learned in the textbook to connect to concrete real world experiences.  Students construct a personal story about their experience understanding financial information, company level risks, and how their store level risk observations evolved and bridged their understanding of abstract financial information to concrete experiences. 

Task #1: Create an individual reflection about the SBUX Project.

Unlike the first four deliverables, deliverable five is solely an individual effort and is not a collaborative effort. Students can discuss how abstract financial information is and how it becomes less abstract as the project evolves, sharing specific instances whereby they did not understand an accounting concept in the beginning of the project, but later began to make sense and understand it. Students are asked to provide specific real or hypothetical instances about how they can use newly discovered skills to help make better accounting business decisions.

Task #2: Individually upload Document via the institution’s course learning management system.

The same parameters for deliverable five apply to the deliverable two and three submission processes.
