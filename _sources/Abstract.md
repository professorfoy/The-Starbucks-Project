# Abstract

Using the Starbucks Corporation as a for-profit retail business setting, we present an experiential learning strategy with the main objective to bridge the gap between abstract theoretical educational accounting concepts learned and concrete, real experiences. We define venue based experiential learning strategies as providing a concrete experience which takes place out of a classroom setting. Working in groups, students analyze financial statements and related disclosures and then go  into the field to observe, interview employees, and analyze Starbucks stores. This learning strategy was implemented with 539 students over a four-year period in 27 undergraduate and graduate accounting classes. Evidence suggests that students appreciated the connection between abstract theoretical education to underlying accounting transactions and financial statement analysis for external accounting reporting purposes.
