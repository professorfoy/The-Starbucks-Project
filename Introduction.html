<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Experiential learning strategies have long been known to successfully transform abstract educational concepts into concrete experiences. Students generally learn better when they have the ability to apply learned concepts to real-world experiences (Dellaportas and Hassall 2013). Scholars have demonstrated that effective learners display four different kinds of abilities—concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation (Kolb et al. 2014; Kolb 2014).</p>
<p>We developed a venue based experiential learning strategy whereby course learning outcomes are achieved by focusing on financial accounting and reporting issues affecting a business. We conceptualize a venue based experiential learning strategy as providing a concrete experience which takes place out of a classroom setting. We implement it with a project that we label: The SBUX (Starbucks) Project (the ticker symbol for Starbucks is SBUX).</p>
<p>The SBUX Project is a semester-long, five deliverable sequential project, addressing shorter term experiential learning project deficiencies noted by Hoxmeier and Lenk (2003) and Wynn-Williams et al. (2008). One of the disadvantages that students have studying accounting is the lack of experience to understand the context of abstract educational concepts being taught. The SBUX Project takes accounting students on a venue based experiential learning journey by extracting financial data from the Starbucks website, explore and prepare the data for analysis, synthesize their analyses with firm and store level risk information, present their findings and reflect on the overall experience. A central experience with the project involves physical visits to local Starbucks stores.</p>
<p>Our research differs from extant accounting educational literature in several important ways. We offer a semester-long project with a flexible and scalable framework that can be implemented virtually to any accounting course, at any level or modality, or class composed solely of accounting students or mixed classes. The project suggests that using a for-profit setting has its advantages. Ravenscroft (2007, 180) makes the case about the importance and desirability of profit-based small business versus nonprofit businesses. Because of Starbuck’s ubiquitous nature, using this type of project also enables instructors to implement venue based experiential learning projects that reach a more global student population. Moreover, the SBUX Project gives support to the growing literature that students generally learn better applying abstract educational concepts to real-world experiences.</p>
<p>The balance of paper is organized as follows. We present a discussion on Experiential Learning in Accounting, the Case and its Requirements, Case Learning Objectives and Implementation Guidance. In separate documents, we provide Instructor Teaching notes and a Step by Step Guide that instructors can use as guidance, modify to their specific needs, and distribute to students upon the beginning of the project.
Experiential Learning In Accounting</p>
<p>Experiential education has been defined as “a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people’s capacity to contribute to their communities (Association for Experiential Education 2016). Experiential learning is a more constructivist approach (as opposed to lecturing) in that knowledge is constructed by learners. For this construction to take place, the learning environment must be rich and reflective of real world contexts to transfer knowledge beyond the classroom (Kirschner 2001). See Moon (2004) for a more comprehensive list of experiential learning definitions.</p>
<p>Experiential learning theory suggests that effective learners develop two levels of experiences: concrete and abstract. Concrete experiences are the basis for reflections which synthesize to understand abstract concepts and develop the ability to act on abstract concepts (Kolb et al. 2014). Learners move in and out of these levels to varying degrees, but many experiential learner theorists agree that reflection is probably the most important stage in learning (Kolb 2014).</p>
<p>Specific mentions of elements of experiential learning in the accounting field did not surface until 2008 with The Pathways Commission. They examined the higher education structure for the accounting profession, including experiential learning processes (Black 2012). The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) embraced experiential learning through Standard 13 for meeting Business and Accounting accreditation (AACSB International 2013) and in its most recent guidance, Standard 4: Curriculum states, “The school’s curriculum promotes and fosters innovation, experiential learning, and a lifelong learning mindset.” (AACSB International 2020, 37-40).</p>
<p>There is much variation in the literature on how faculty in different schools have implemented experiential learning projects that take students out of the classroom environment and into the real world physical environment. Gittings et al. (2020) give a systematic review, but the general activities when students leave the classroom have been centered on service learning and Internal Revenue Service Volunteer Tax Assistance Program (VITA) programs. Service learning is a specialized form of experiential learning combining academic study with community service, often involving work with nonprofit organizations (Rama 2011). The VITA program is an IRS initiative designed to support free tax preparation service for the underserved through various partner organizations (Internal Revenue Service 2021). For examples of specific accounts in VITA involvement, Boneck et al. (2014), Carr (2007), Oestreich et al. (2007) and Bootsma et al. (2021) discuss how they implemented and assessed the VITA program in their respective schools.</p>
<p>Lenk and Donnelly (1998) use a real nonprofit organization case study to facilitate discussions for students to step in the shoes of leader and team player positions, and examine financial statements and question internal controls. Roberts and Zamora (2012) engage their students with the nonprofit organization One Laptop per Child. Michenzi (2007) had his students work with local nonprofit organizations to act as consultants on Information Systems (IS) type projects. Lenk (2007) implemented a four stage strategic alliance model whereby students visited nonprofit organizations and identified research issues. Hoxmeier and Lenk (2003) discuss an array of IS service-learning projects with nonprofit organizations. Woolley (2007) discussed how accounting students addressed IS needs for local nonprofits dealing with tax matters and financial statements.</p>
<p>We know of no such formal definition employing a strategy whereby students leave the classroom to engage in real life activities. Field trips or field work is the more general term employed, but a field trip or field work may be devoid of critical aspects of experiential learning. Service learning is a more narrowly scoped conceptualization dealing with the aspect of community service. Since there is no formal definition established, we define it as venue based experiential learning, conceptualized in the current research as providing a concrete experience which takes place out of a classroom setting. It is more holistic and aligned more with situated learning and the importance of place (Dellaportas and Hassall 2013) and to include environment and all its factors that provide the stimulus to learning (Wilson and Beard 2003). For a concise explanation between experiential learning, service learning and situated learning see Bootsma et al. (2021). It is the concrete experience in the Kolb Experiential Learning Theory model that venue based experiential learning has the greatest impact. The primary goal in this type of experiential learning is to get students out of the classroom to maximize thinking, feeling, perceiving, and behaving opportunities.</p>
